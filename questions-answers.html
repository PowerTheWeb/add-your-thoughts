          <span>Ans:</span>
          As mentioned above, Computers understand instructions that are written
          in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A
          programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task
          so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. Refer our
          another blog-post "What is programming language?" to know more about
          programming languages. Some of the popular Programming languages are
          Python, C, C++, Java, etc

          <span>Ans:</span>
          Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate
          with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and
          writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to
          write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a
          much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps,
          process data, and do lots of other cool things.
