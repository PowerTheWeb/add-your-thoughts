          <span>Ans:</span>
          As mentioned above, Computers understand instructions that are written
          in a specific syntactical form called a programming language. A
          programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task
          so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. Refer our
          another blog-post "What is programming language?" to know more about
          programming languages. Some of the popular Programming languages are
          Python, C, C++, Java, etc

        <h2>What is coding?</h2>

          <span>Ans:</span>
          Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate
          with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and
          writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to
          write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a
          much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps,
          process data, and do lots of other cool things.

                It is a set of computer programs which is usually 
                associated with documentation and data. It works along side but is different
                from hardware in which the system is built upon
                and performs its functions.

            <!-- write answer here -->
            <p><span>Ans:</span>
                Coding forms part of programming in that the code that is written is understood by the machine. Programming, on the other hand, creates the program that the code wrote.

                A compiler is a type of software that translates 
                computer code written in one programming language 
                into another language. This terms usually refers to 
                programs that take source code from a high-level 
                programming language and translates it to a 
                lower level language to create an executable program.
