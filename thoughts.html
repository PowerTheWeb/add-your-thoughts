                    There have been many debates over the ethical and moral implications of AI. 
                    Because of the mass usage of AI, many people are concerned with the viability
                    and reliability of such. Loss of jobs with AI replacements has been a looming
                    concern for many years, with statistics showing that about 800 million people
                    will lose their jobs by 2030. AI could increase the wealth inequality as well,
                    with companies that can afford these technologies, not needing to pay directly
                    for workers. This in turn generates more profit for these companies and making
                    the CEOs and stakeholders even richer. AI’s are not perfect either and can make
                    mistakes, which can result in harm being caused to people. There is also a 
                    concern for the possibility of rogue AI’s, having machines become self-aware
                    and if will be able to control them or if they will take over, this fear 
                    being showcased in the movie “Terminator”. As AI continues to develop, the
                    treatment of AI’s is also something to consider if they are evolved to 
                    the point of being able to have “feelings”. Such as in the case of the AI
                    “Sophia” who was granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia, the question of 
                    “Should AI be granted status and rights similar to those of humans?” is
                    still being debated. Bias in AI has become a worry for many people as well,
                    with many systems such as facial and voice recognition relying on AI to make
                    decisions. If these decisions are made with any favour or bias towards a 
                    race, religion, sex or different factor, these can have massive effects on
                    the parties involved and can massive impacts them, for better or for worse.
                    Although there are many practical concerns regarding the morality and ethics
                    of AI, many of these concerns are still far into the future and are being 
                    actively addressed and worked on today. The idea of AI taking over is scary
                    and the issues raised by them are complex but with proper analysis and 
                    judgement, AI can become one of the most beneficial investments for all of mankind.
